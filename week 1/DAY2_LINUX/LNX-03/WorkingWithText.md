# LNX-03 Working With Text (CLI)
- Understanding the different text operations using Linux Command Line Interface(CLI)
- Linux operating system allows to change standard input and standard output when executing a command on the terminal. This function is called Input/Output redirection.

## Key terminology/commands used in LNX
- mkdir (make directory)
- touch (create file)
- echo (print in terminal)
- echo text > filename (print content to a file)
- echo text >> filename (append newline to a file)
- cat (print) - to read the file and print the content in terminal
- grep (global regular expression print) - to search for a string of characters in a specified line
- pipe (|) redirection used to send output of one program to another
