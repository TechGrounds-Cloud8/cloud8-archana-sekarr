### Daily Report

 Created requirements doc,Jira board and created vpc with private subnets.
### Challenges

 I was confused whether to use private with nat or isolated subnet
### Solutions

Figured out nat costs 0.04cents per hour and it's very expensive. Also, Nat isnt required in this case.

### Learnings

Nat is not required as we can use load balancer to connect to the internet instead.

### Daily Report

Created ASG and ASG policy
 
### Challenges

I was working with a teammate and we realized that we approached the launch template differently. 
### Solutions

For now, both the methods work so I think it should be fine.
### Learnings

I learnt that the launch template can either be created separately or attach the same from AMI we used for ec2 web server.
