### Overcome challanges

I understood the concept by referring to the sources shared above.

### Results

We will see how we can execute a lambda using a test event:

1. Creating a lambda from blueprint:

2. Lambda function overview:

4. But in this exercise, I am going to be creating a test event to trigger the lambda:
