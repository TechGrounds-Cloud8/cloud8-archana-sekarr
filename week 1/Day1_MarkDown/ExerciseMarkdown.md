# Markdown

## Key terminology
- WYSIWYG vs WYSIWYM
- WYSIWYG - In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases and the changes are visible immediately.

- WYSIWYM - Markdown is a WYSIWYM. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

- Heading One - #
