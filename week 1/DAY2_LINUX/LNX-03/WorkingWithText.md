# LNX-03 Working With Text (CLI)
- Understanding the different text operations using Linux Command Line Interface(CLI)
- Linux operating system allows to change standard input and standard output when executing a command on the terminal. This function is called Input/Output redirection.

## Key terminology/commands used in LNX
- mkdir (make directory)
- touch (create file)
- echo (print in terminal)
- echo text > filename (print content to a file)
- echo text >> filename (append newline to a file)
- cat (print) - to read the file and print the content in terminal
- grep (global regular expression print) - to search for a string of characters in a specified line
- pipe (|) redirection used to send output of one program to another

## Exercise
- Use the echo command and output redirection to write a new sentence into your text file using the command line. The new sentence should contain the word ‘techgrounds’.
- Use a command to write the contents of your text file to the terminal. Make use of a command to filter the output so that only the sentence containing ‘techgrounds’ appears.
- Read your text file with the command used in the second step, once again filtering for the word ‘techgrounds’. This time, redirect the output to a new file called ‘techgrounds.txt’.

### Overcome challanges
- This assignment seemed to be a continuation of the previous one so it helped in understanding the commands better.

### Results

By using the different text operations, these were the results.
