# LNX-06 Processes
A process is an instance of a running code. There are three categories of processes run in Linux and each serves different purposes.
1. Daemons - It runs in the background and it is non-interactive
2. Services - It may be interactive and Services respond to requests from programs.
3. Programs - It is run and used by users.

SSH(secure shell) is used to connect to remote Linux machines. To make this connection to your machine possible, youâ€™ll have to start the ssh service by starting the ssh daemon. Telnet was used before SSH. It is an outdated and not secure/encrypted network protocol used to virtually access a computer. 

## Key terminology
- Init process - mother(parent) of all processes on the system. It is the first program that is executed when Linux system boots up; it manages all other processes on the system.
- PID - process ID - every process has it's own PID
- ps command - it is used to locate a process. It displays information about the active processes on the system; though not in the form of an interface
- pgrep PROCESSNAME - command used to retrieve PID based on the process name.
- top command - displays list of all currently running processes along with it's memory usage 
- kill PID/PROCESSNAME command helps to kill a process in Linux; telnetd in case of this exercise.

## Exercise
- Start the telnet daemon
- Find out the PID of the telnet daemon
- Find out how much memory telnetd is using
- Stop or kill the telnetd process

### Overcome challanges
This is not necessarily a challenge but these are my learnings from this exercise. This exercise helped me understand that there are multiple commands to kill a process but I went ahead with one command as shown below yet I want to explore more about the other possibilities too in the future. 

### Results

Following are the results derived based on the commands used.

1. Installing the telnet daemon

2. PID of the telnet daemon

3. Memory used by telnet is 0.1%
