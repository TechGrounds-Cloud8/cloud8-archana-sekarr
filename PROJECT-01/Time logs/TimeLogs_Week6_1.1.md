### Daily Report

Created a certificate for https. 
### Challenges

Tyring to fix the 502 bad gateway

### Solutions

Still not yet figured. If I disable the allocation of public ip for the ec2 instance in the public subnet, the healt checks fail because of which the load balancer returns a 502 bad gateway.

### Learnings

I learnt about AWS Certificate Manager and the wildcards.
