Installed open ssh client and open ssh server on the windows instance. 
### Challenges

Initially i was trying to log into the web server using putty client which was quite a task. 

### Solutions


With the help of my teammates I learnt that i can use the ssh proxy command to connect to the web server via the admin server.
