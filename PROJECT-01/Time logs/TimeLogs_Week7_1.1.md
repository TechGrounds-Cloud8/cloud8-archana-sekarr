### Learnings

I learnt that the user data file can be corrupted sometimes when pushed to Git and thats why the script wont get executed. So creating a new script will help solve the issue. This link helps in understanding the ^M error https://www.atechtown.com/remove-ctrl-m-character/.

### Daily Report

Documentation and changing architectural design all over again

### Challenges

According to my understanding, the ASG will deploy the ec2 instances in the public subnets.  But the requirement asks for deployment in the private subnets for which we need NAT and we aren’t doing it. So my question arises whether to keep the web servers in both the subnets for the architecture or should it be just in the public subnet according the configuration I’ve given.

Documentation and fixed my architecture.

### Solutions

Have the web server only in the public subnet because thats what my code says.

### Learnings

After discussing with my coaches, i learnt that I should do the architecture based on my code and not what the requirements have asked if I havent met that based on my discussions with the stakeholders.
