### Overcome challanges

This exercise was quite straightforward and I learnt about the advantages in the link mentioned above along with the knowledge I gained from the previous exercises.

### Results

Six Advantages of Cloud Computing:

 1. Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx): In the traditional model, you spend a lot of money in buying new equipments and for setting up data centers whereas in the case of cloud, you only pay for the services you use and how much you consume, which translates into the pay-as-you-go pricing model. By using Cloud, captial expenses (CapEX) can be traded for operating expenses (OpEx) which will eliminate the risk of investing heavily in purchase of servers/data centers for future usage which are not necessarily certain at the time of investment. 
 
 With CapEx, your expenses are tax deductible over a depreciation lifetime which can be several years whereas in the case of OpEx model, your expenses are tax deductible in the same tax year. 

 2. Benefit from massive economies of scale:
 Since AWS has a large customer base, they have the purchasing power to lower their costs and pass that on to customers which translates into lower variable costs for it's customers.

 3. Stop guessing capacity:
 When you plan your workload in the beginning, you often have an idea of what you need in terms of the amount of processing power, storage capacity but in reality after deploiding your workload, you often realize there are a lot of wasted resources. This uncertainty can be eliminated with Cloud, where you can adjust your capacity based on the demand. 

 4. Increase speed and agility:
With Cloud computing, all the IT services are just a click away. This means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

 5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers:
 Cloud computing enables organziations to purely focus on creating new products and bringing in innovations to meet the changing needs of the customers instead of maintaining and creating your own infrastructure.

 6. Go global in minutes: 
 Cloud computing allows you to deploy your solutions worldwide in different data centers. This can allow you to reduce the latency for your users and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.
