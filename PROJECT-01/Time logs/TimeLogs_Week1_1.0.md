### Daily Report

Translated the entire project document to english and tried to understand the project expectations. 


### Challenges

Since this is my first project experience in Cloud, it was quite overwhelming in the beginning 

### Solutions

I decided to break the document into parts so I that I can understand every aspect of it


### Learnings

Prepare your mind to accept that project documents are mostly long. Instead of reading it all at once, take breaks and read it in parts.

### Challenges

The project document seemed very lengthy and it needed more clarity for further reference.

Further tweaked the Jira stories to create realistic user stories. 


### Challenges

After discussing the Jira stories with my teammates, I learnt that i had to further break down my story board into smaller parts so that it can be realistic to finish the tasks.


### Solutions

I updated my Jira board, for instance, initially i stated 'Create VM and encrypt'. I changed that to two tasks. 


### Learnings

It's always good to create smaller tasks in Jira board.
