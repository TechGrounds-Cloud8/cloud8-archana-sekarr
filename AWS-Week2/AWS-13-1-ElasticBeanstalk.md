# Elastic Beanstalk

Developing an application and managing is an expensive and time-consuming process. AWS offers Beanstalk to manage this process. 

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

It takes 
In simple terms, this platform as a service (PaaS - because it eliminates the management of instracture) takes your application code and deploys it while provisioning the supporting architecture and compute resources required for your code to run. Elastic Beanstalk also fully manages the patching and security updates for those provisioned resources. 

You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.

There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk to deply your applications, you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.

Elastic Beanstalk takes care of the hosting infrastructure, coding language interpreter, operating system, security, https service and application layer. All you need to worry about is writing your code.

You can develop code in a number of languages which is then zipped up and the zip file is used when instantiating a new elastic beanstalk instance.

To summarise, the significant features of Elastic Beanstalk are:

1. Elastic Beanstalk is possibly the simplest and fastest way to deploy web applications on AWS.

2. It allows developers to focus on writing code instead of provisioning and configuring AWS resources.

3. Elastic beanstalk handles the auto scaling of resources needed to support your deployed application as demand grows or shrinks.

4. When Elastic Beanstalk analyses your application and selects the resources that will be requires, it also allows you to step in and select alternative resources that may be better suited to anticipated use cases it may not know about. For example you could select a higher spec EC2 instance type that better suits your needs.
